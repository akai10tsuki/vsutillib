Introduction

This library is published as support for MKVBatchMultiplex_ installation.  As I
get ideas and work on more applications it became complicated to maintain the
library private and release the applications without requiring to much effort.
There are many functions and classes not bound to the application that will be
documented over time.  Everything is as is there is no warranty that the
library is fit for any particular use.
