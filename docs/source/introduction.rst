Introduction
============

This library is published as support for MKVBatchMultiplex_ installation.  As I
work on more applications it became complicated to maintain the library private
and only pull what I need with each applications. This started to require to
much effort and some time had to do back ports to fixes. There are many
functions and classes not bound to a particular application that will be
documented over time.

Everything is as is there is no warranty that the library is fit for any
particular use.
