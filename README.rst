These are a collection of functions and classes that I use on
my applications to made easier to maintain I decided to release
it and install as a dependency of apps like mkvbatchmultiplex.

Description
===========

A range of functions and classes with a variety of uses for
example:

 - functions

   * **getFileList** - return the files on a directory in
     **list** of pathlib.Path objects
   * **findFile** - find a file in the system Path
     return a pathlib.Path object if found
   * **getExecutable** - find executable file
     in PATH and the normal installation paths for Windows
     and macOS for linux is like findFile

 - classes

   * **RunCommand** - execute command in subprocess and capture
     output optionally apply regular expression searches
     and apply a supplied function to receive every line
     read and process them as needed
   * **ConfigurationSettings** - maintain a set of ConfigurationSettings
     in a **dictionary** and saved it in xml file

 - utilities

   * **dsf2wv** - compresses DSF audio files to WavPack compressed
     files
   * **mkvrun** - CLI utility to execute MKVToolNix_ generated
     command line.  MKVBatchMultiplex_ is a GUI implementation
     of this and the main reason this module goes public.
   * **apply2files** - apply a command to all files in the directory
     specified in recursive by default

and so on...

Installation
============

::

  pip install vsutillib
  or download the source

Main development platform is Windows but the majority of functions
work on Linux and macOS.  Some are OS specific like isDarkMode that
detect if macOS Mojave is running in Dark Mode.  If the function is
run on Linux or Windows always returns **False**.

Dependencies
************

    * lxml_ 4.3.3 or greater on system
      XmlDB simple xml database
    * pymediainfo_ 4.0 or greater
      MediaFileInfo depends on it
    * Python_ 3.5->3.7
    * MediaInfo_ tested with versions 17.10->18.12.
      This is only for Linux a dependency of pymediainfo.
    * MKVToolNix_ tested with versions 17.00->34.0.0
      mkvrun depends on it.
    * WavPack_ file compressor 5.1.0 or greater
      dsf2wv depends on it.

lxml and pymediainfo are installed automatically they are the only
python libraries used.  The other programs follow website instructions.
Besides lxml all dependencies are for very specific uses if you don't
have them on your system not much functionality is lost.

On macOS 10.14 Dark Mode MKVToolNix has to be version 30.0.0+

Usage
=====

Import the the library in your program:
::

  from vsutillib import mkv
  from vsutillib import media
  from vsutillib import mprocess
